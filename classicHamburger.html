    <h1><strong><em>Classic Hamburger</em></strong></h1>
    <!--Description-->
    <p>Sink your teeth into the ultimate classic cheeseburger experience! Picture this:<br> 
       a juicy, flame-kissed beef patty nestled between two perfectly toasted sesame seed buns.<br>
       Now imagine a generous blanket of ooey-gooey melted cheddar cheese cascading over that savory meat,<br> 
       creating a symphony of flavor that'll make your taste buds dance. But we're not done yet!<br> 
       We top it off with crisp lettuce, juicy tomato slices, and zesty pickles for that extra<br> 
       kick of freshness and crunch. Every bite is a mouthwatering explosion of savory, cheesy,<br> 
       and downright delicious goodness. This isn't just any burgerâ€”it's a culinary masterpiece 
       that'll leave you craving more.
