    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol> <!--order list-->
        <li>Prepare the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Form the Patties: Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and shape </li>
        <li>Grill the Patties: Place the patties on the preheated grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until desired level of doneness is reached. During the last few minutes of cooking, brush each patty with teriyaki sauce and place a slice of Swiss cheese on top of each patty to melt.</li>
        <li>Grill the Pineapple: While the patties are cooking, grill the pineapple slices for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they develop grill marks and caramelize slightly.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Burgers: Toast the hamburger buns on the grill for a minute or two until lightly golden. Spread mayonnaise or your preferred condiment on the bottom half of each bun. Place a lettuce leaf on top of the condiment, followed by a cooked hamburger patty with melted cheese. Add a slice of grilled pineapple, a slice of tomato, a slice of cooked bacon, and a few slices of red onion. Top with the other half of the hamburger bun.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve your Hawaiian hamburgers immediately while still warm. Enjoy the tropical flavors!</li>
