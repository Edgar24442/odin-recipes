        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol> <!--order list-->
            <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Form the ground beef into four equal portions and shape them into hamburger patties. Season both sides of each patty with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until desired level of doneness is reached. During the last few minutes of cooking, brush each patty with BBQ sauce and place a slice of cheddar cheese on top of each patty to melt.</li>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, grill the bacon slices until crispy.</li>
            <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill for a minute or two until lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Spread BBQ sauce on the bottom half of each bun. Place a lettuce leaf on top of the sauce, followed by a cooked hamburger patty with melted cheese. Add a slice of tomato, a slice of cooked bacon, and a few slices of red onion. Top with the other half of the hamburger bun.</li>
            <li>Serve your BBQ hamburgers immediately while still warm. Enjoy the smoky, tangy flavors!</li>
